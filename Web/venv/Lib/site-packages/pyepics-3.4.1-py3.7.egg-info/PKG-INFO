Description: Python Interface to the Epics Channel Access protocol
        of the Epics control system.   PyEpics provides 3 layers of access to
        Channel Access (CA):
        
        1. a light wrapping of the CA C library calls, using ctypes. This
           provides a procedural CA library in which the user is expected
           to manage Channel IDs. It is mostly provided as a foundation
           upon which higher-level access is built.
        2. PV() (Process Variable) objects, which represent the basic object
           in CA, allowing one to keep a persistent connection to a remote
           Process Variable.
        3. A simple set of functions caget(), caput() and so on to mimic
           the CA command-line tools and give the simplest access to CA.
        
        In addition, the library includes convenience classes to define
        Devices -- collections of PVs that might represent an Epics Record
        or physical device (say, a camera, amplifier, or power supply), and
        to help write GUIs for CA.
